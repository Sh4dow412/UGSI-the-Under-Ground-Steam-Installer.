# UGSI-the-Under-Ground-Steam-Installer.
UGSI installs Steam without admin rights by using RunAsInvoker and a custom folder. It auto-downloads Steam, guides setup, self-cleans, and lets you rename the install folder afterward. You can also hide it with Windows’ Hidden attribute for a cleaner setup.
